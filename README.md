# comp150-desktop-game
A desktop game made collaboratively using C++ and SDL.


##Aesthetic
This game intends to create feelings of tension and fear of the unknown.
####Mechanics that help create this aesthetic
* The player is pursued by the monster if they spend too long in a level, meaning that that the player feels pressured to make quick decisions and not loiter around being indecisive
* The player has limited view, so must decide which direction to travel without knowing exactly what lies ahead
* Levels are randomly generated, which means that the player doesn't know what to expect each time they play
* The game's dark theme of being trapped in a Nazi hospital also adds feelings of horror and fear

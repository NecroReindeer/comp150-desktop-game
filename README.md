# comp150-desktop-game
A desktop game made collaboratively using C++ and SDL.

#Sprint 1
There were some struggles at the beginning of the project due to a differing level of experience between team members. In order to overcome this, we did a lot of pair programming in this sprint. 
James and Harriet used pair programming in order to create classes for the NPCs and make them appear in the game. This proved effective, as we managed to complete all of the user stories on our to-do list.

In future, it will be useful to use pair programming if team members are struggling to implement a particular element, as it allows the problem to be overcome through discussion, learning, and picking up on each other’s mistakes.

#Sprint 2
There was less communication and pair programming during the second sprint. This had a negative effect on the outcome of sprint, as we still had a lot of user stories left incomplete.
Harriet continued working on the level generator whilst James attempted to implement movement for the NPCs. 
After struggling for a while, James asked the tutor and other team members for help. Asking for help allowed James to get the NPCs to move in a straight line.

In order to avoid time being wasted by being stumped by a difficult problem, asking team members and tutors for help sooner rather than later will mean that it has a lesser impact on the progress of the project. Participating in daily stand-up meetings would help address this issue, as team members would raise any issues they are having during that.

#Sprint 3
We didn’t achieve many of the user stories during this sprint, due to a lack of communication over the Easter holidays, until the week of the sprint review.
Harriet continued working on the level generation and split the level into rooms and corridors, whilst James worked on beginning to implement the behaviour for the NPCs’ movement.

It is important that the team maintains regular communication in future in order to 


#Sprint 4
Milly worked on implementing collision detection during this sprint. After struggling to implement it, he asked the tutors and other team members for help. This allowed a solution to the problem to be found, so now the player cannot travel through walls, and restarts when colliding with an NPC

##Target market
This game is aimed at people that enjoy roguelites as well as people that enjoy darkly themed, yet non-traditional, horror games that elicit feelings of tension.
It is aimed at people that enjoy a challenge, and don't feel put off by losing a few times. 
Aimed at masochistic gamers!

##Aesthetic
This game intends to create feelings of tension and fear of the unknown.
####Mechanics that help create this aesthetic
* The player is pursued by the monster if they spend too long in a level, meaning that that the player feels pressured to make quick decisions and not loiter around being indecisive
* The player has limited view, so must decide which direction to travel without knowing exactly what lies ahead
* Levels are randomly generated, which means that the player doesn't know what to expect each time they play
* The game's dark theme of being trapped in a Nazi hospital also adds feelings of horror and fear
